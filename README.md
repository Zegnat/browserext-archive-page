## This repository is a mirror

This repository contains a single commit for each version of the add-on that has
been published on AMO. This way changes to the add-on can easily be reviewed
before installation.

There is also a mirror repository for the Chrome version:
[karlhorky/mirror-jnavas2-archive-page][mirror].

## The Firefox Add-on is no longer on AMO

As of at least 2025-06-28 the (dead link) [AMO page][AMO] has been offline. As
of 2025-06-20 [the official GitHub repository][a754223] dropped support.

The final version of the add-on that has been distributed on AMO was **version
0.9.0**. This was also the final version available under the **MIT License**.
See the [Version 0.9.0 commit on this repository][c0f51de].

## Notes on historic releases

It seems like the release history of the add-on was removed from AMO when 0.9.0
released. These old versions are also untracked by the official repository.
They are mirrored here for posterity.

All old versions were obtained through [the Wayback Machine][IA]. The exact URLs
are available in each separate version commit. See [the history of the “version
history” page][history] on archive.today.

## Notes on the licence

The add-on licence has been distributed inside the XPI file since version 0.3 as
[copyright.txt](./copyright.txt) and is reproduced in this repository. On AMO it
has been identified as “MIT/X11 License”, “The MIT License” and “MIT License”.

It matches the text of [SPDX MIT License](SPDX).

The official repository has undergone a number of licence changes but these seem
to have been after the publication of the latest add-on version and do not apply
to any code in this mirror repository.

**2025-03-19:**

1. [The MIT License was removed][21287bc].
2. [The Personal Use Software License was introduced][5c72588].

**2025-03-21:**

4. [The Personal Use Software License was removed][e2b3994].
5. [The Archive Page Non-Commercial License was introduced][a69afc1].

No origin for these licences has been identified, nor do they seem to have an
SPDX identifier. The current official repository licence grants permission to
copy and redistribute, so future versions of the add-on can still be
mirrored here.
