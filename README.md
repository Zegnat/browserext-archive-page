## This repository is a mirror

This repository contains a single commit for each version of the add-on that has
been published for Firefox. This way changes to the add-on can easily be
reviewed before installation.

There is also a mirror repository for the Chrome version:
[karlhorky/mirror-jnavas2-archive-page][mirror].

## The Firefox Add-on is no longer on AMO

As of at least 2025-06-28 the (dead link) [AMO page][AMO] has been offline. As
of 2025-06-20 [the official GitHub repository][a754223] dropped support.

The final version of the add-on that has been distributed on AMO was **version
0.9.0**. This was also the final version available under the **MIT License**.
See the [Version 0.9.0 commit on this repository][c0f51de].

## Notes on historic releases

It seems like the release history of the add-on was removed from AMO when 0.9.0
released. These old versions are also untracked by the official repository.
They are mirrored here for posterity.

All old versions were obtained through [the Wayback Machine][IA]. The exact URLs
are available in each separate version commit. See [the history of the “version
history” page][history] on archive.today.

## Notes on the licence

The add-on licence has been distributed inside the XPI file from version 0.3 to
0.9.0 as copyright.txt. On AMO it has been identified as “MIT/X11 License”,
“The MIT License” and “MIT License”.

From version 0.9.1 onward the licence has not been packaged with the add-on,
instead this repository includes the licence that could be found in the official
repository at the time of publication.

No origin for these licences has been identified, nor do they seem to have an
SPDX identifier. This repository will continue to track versions as long as the
licence allows for publication and distribution.
